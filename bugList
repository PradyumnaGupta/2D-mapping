--->to be modified to take input from a .txt file
bug in it..
    the (actual)bot will turn to right<R>(say) and then move forward<F>, and accordingly will be the input to the code.
    
    the code (at present) will not continue to draw path in rightward direction once it starts getting <F>s after the <R>.
